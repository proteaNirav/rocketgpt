# RocketGPT – GitHub Copilot Guardrails (LOCKED)

Copilot is used as a **code assistant**, not an architect.

## Copilot IS allowed to:
- Generate boilerplate code
- Create DTOs / interfaces / schemas
- Write unit tests and mocks
- Add comments and documentation
- Refactor small, explicitly selected blocks

## Copilot is NOT allowed to:
- Design architecture
- Modify orchestrator flow
- Change Control Plane logic
- Introduce autonomy
- Alter Decision Contracts or governance
- Auto-commit code
- Touch security boundaries unless instructed

## Working Pattern (MANDATORY)
1. Human defines intent and boundaries
2. Copilot generates code
3. Human reviews every line
4. Human commits

Copilot is treated as a **junior developer**.
All authority remains with humans.

Violation of these rules = discard Copilot output.
