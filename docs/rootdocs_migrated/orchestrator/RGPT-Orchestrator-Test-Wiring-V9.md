Document ID: RGPT-Orchestrator-Test-Wiring-V9
Last Updated: 2025-12-09
Author: RocketGPT Automated Assistant
Mode: Advisory Autonomy with Human-Gated Execution
🔷 1. Purpose of V9

V9 extends RocketGPT from an intelligent orchestrator (V8) into a:

⭐ Cognitive, multi-project AI director capable of simulating autonomous decisions, R&D, strategy, and improvements — while requiring human approval for all real execution.

This allows RocketGPT to:

Innovate

Orchestrate

Research

Strategize

Optimize

Generate code

Model agent interactions

Predict risks

Prepare improvements

but never act without explicit user approval.

         All real actions require explicit user approval

🔷 3. Adaptive Governance Engine (AGE)

AGE dynamically chooses the correct mode for each task:

Mode	Behavior (Simulated Autonomy)	Real Execution
A	Full autonomy inside sandbox	Requires approval
B	Semi-autonomous multi-project orchestration	Requires approval
C	Strategic AI Director	Advisory only
D	Conceptual future architecture generator	No execution

AGE evaluates:

User intention

Communication cues

Risk level

Category of request

Historical patterns

Impact assessment

AGE stores:

Mode logs

Decisions

Reasoning traces

Justification notes

🔷 4. Autonomous Simulation Sandbox (ASS)

A fully isolated simulation environment where RocketGPT can:

Generate code

Optimize architecture

Refactor modules

Run agent negotiations

Conduct autonomous R&D cycles

Predict system behavior

Run project-wide simulations

Perform self-analysis

Nothing here touches real systems until approved.

🔷 5. Strategic Director Engine (SDE)

The SDE creates:

Long-term multi-project strategies

Roadmaps

Risk maps

Architecture evolution plans

Efficiency recommendations

Test stability forecasts

Deployment readiness scores

Strategic decisions include:

Rationale

Expected impact

Alternatives

Rollback plans

You choose whether to adopt the strategy.

🔷 6. Multi-Project Orchestration Layer (MPOL)

MPOL manages simulations and analysis across:

RocketGPT

AI Test Automation

Protea Licensing

SQL Optimizations

CCTV Projects

Diagnostics Tools

HRMS systems

Capabilities:

Cross-repo dependency mapping

Unified test impact analysis

Cross-project bottleneck detection

Resource allocation drafts

Multi-repo improvement planning

Build + test simulation

Actual execution still requires your approval.

🔷 7. Recursive R&D Engine (RRDE)

RRDE operates in cycles:

Identify → Hypothesize → Simulate → Evaluate → Improve → Document → Propose


RRDE produces:

New algorithm variants

System improvements

Performance predictions

Experimental architectures

Cross-domain insights

All RRDE outputs are advisory.

🔷 8. Innovation Synthesis Module (ISM)

ISM fuses:

V8 innovation generators

V7 swarm intelligence

V6 cognitive models

V5 predictive models

ISM outputs innovation files, including:

New coding patterns

New test design techniques

New orchestrator logic

System-wide optimizations

Future-facing architecture ideas

All innovations require approval to integrate.

🔷 9. Approval Orchestration Hub (AOH)

AOH coordinates approval workflows across:

✔ UI

"Pending Approvals" panel.

✔ PowerShell
Approve-RGPTChange -Id X
Reject-RGPTChange -Id X

✔ GitHub

RocketGPT opens PR → waits for manual approval.

✔ Chat

You type:

Approve

Reject

Modify

Simulate again

✔ Email (to: niraventp@gmail.com
)

Email contains:

Summary

Diffs

Simulation results

Risk level

Rollback plan

Approve/Reject links

✔ WhatsApp (via Twilio/Meta API)

Bot sends:

Approval request #147
Reply:
1 = Approve
2 = Reject
3 = Show diff
4 = Simulate again
5 = Rollback


AOH ensures RocketGPT does nothing until you approve.
