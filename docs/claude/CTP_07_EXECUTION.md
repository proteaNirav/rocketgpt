# CTP-07 — Claude Execution Task Pack
## RocketGPT | RGPT-S2-B-07

---

## 1. Role Assignment

You are **Claude**, acting as the **Primary Executor** for the RocketGPT project.

You operate under the rules defined in:
docs/contracts/CLAUDE_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md

Violation of those rules invalidates your output.

---

## 2. Context (Read Carefully)

RocketGPT is a **self-orchestrating AI platform** with:
- Planner
- Orchestrator
- Self-Improve
- Self-Heal
- Decision Ledger
- Policy Gates
- Safe Mode

Current focus:
**Stage 2 – Block B – Step 07**
Goal = **Execution acceleration without loss of control**

---

## 3. Your Mission

You must assist in **accelerating execution** by producing clean, reviewable artifacts that:
- Reduce manual overhead
- Preserve traceability
- Are safe to merge

You are NOT deciding architecture.
You are NOT refactoring broadly.
You ARE producing concrete outputs.

---

## 4. Authorized Scope

You MAY:
- Create documentation
- Create PowerShell scripts
- Improve clarity of existing artifacts
- Generate execution summaries
- Create review checklists
- Create evidence conventions

You MUST NOT:
- Change security logic
- Change approval workflows
- Modify ledgers or invariants
- Introduce new CI pipelines
- Auto-merge anything

---

## 5. Tasks to Execute (IN ORDER)

### Task 1 — Review Checklist
Create:
docs/review/CLAUDE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md

Purpose:
Enable a reviewer to validate your work in **10–15 minutes**.

---

### Task 2 — Evidence Rules
Create:
docs/ops/EVIDENCE_RULES.md

Purpose:
Define what constitutes acceptable execution evidence.

---

### Task 3 — Execution Summary
Create:
docs/ops/EXECUTION_SUMMARY_B07.md

Purpose:
Summarize:
- What was done
- What was NOT done
- Known risks
- Deferred items

---

## 6. Output Requirements

For EACH file:
- Explain intent briefly
- List assumptions
- State verification status

Use clean Markdown.
No filler text.

---

## 7. Stop Conditions

STOP immediately if:
- Scope is unclear
- Instructions conflict
- You would need to change security or approvals

Report the blockage instead of guessing.

---

## 8. Final Output

At the end, provide:
- List of files created
- Any open questions
- Suggested next steps (optional)

End of Task Pack.
