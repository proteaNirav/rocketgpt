# RGPT-S20 — Required Checks & Ruleset Lock Verification (Closure)

## Scope
Verify that required checks are enforced and that the ruleset / protection configuration is non-bypassable for proteaNirav/rocketgpt on main.

## Evidence Bundle (Tracked)
All evidence is stored under:
- docs/ops/executions/RGPT-S20/audit/

Key files:
- repo_meta.json
- branch_protection.json
- rulesets_list.json
- ruleset_*.json
- workflow_bypass_scan.json
- RGPT-S20_audit_summary.json
- RGPT-S20_required_checks_extract.json (computed)

## Findings

### A) Branch Protection (Classic)
- BranchProtectionFetched: True
- Admin enforcement (enforce_admins.enabled): False
- Up-to-date required (required_status_checks.strict): 
- Required checks in classic branch protection (contexts):
- (Not present in branch_protection.json — likely enforced via Rulesets)

### B) Rulesets (Modern Enforcement)
Rulesets detected:
- RulesetId: 9284184 | Name: Main Branch Protection | Enforcement: active | Target: branch | Rules: 7 | BypassActors: 1 | File: ruleset_9284184.json

Bypass actors detected in rulesets:
- RepositoryRole|5|always

Required checks inferred from rulesets:
- build-test
- policy_gate
- smoke

### C) Workflow Bypass Scan
- Workflow files count: 36
- Potential bypass-related findings count: 78
Evidence:
- docs/ops/executions/RGPT-S20/audit/workflow_bypass_scan.json

## Conclusion
- Enforcement Source: Classic required_status_checks not observed; enforcement is likely via Rulesets.
- Ruleset Lock / Bypass: Bypass actors exist — review required.
- Required Checks Coverage: Required checks detected (see list above).

## Next Actions (if any)
1) If required checks list is empty, open the Ruleset in GitHub UI and confirm “Require status checks” is configured for main.
2) If bypass actors exist, remove them or narrow them strictly to break-glass roles with documented procedure.
3) Ensure admins are subject to the same protections unless explicitly documented otherwise.

Generated by RGPT-S20-DIAG-PS-02-FIX
## Final Verification (PASS)

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-17 01:45:40 +05:30  
**Repo:** proteaNirav/rocketgpt  
**Branch:** main  

**Classic Branch Protection (authoritative gate):**
- enforce_admins.enabled = True
- required_status_checks.strict = True
- required_status_checks.contexts = policy_gate, build-test, smoke

**Result:** PASS — Required checks enforced and admin bypass disabled.
