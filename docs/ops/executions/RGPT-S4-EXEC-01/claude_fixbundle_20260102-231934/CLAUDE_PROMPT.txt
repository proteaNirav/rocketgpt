You are fixing RocketGPT (Next.js app) Decision Ledger Runtime Binding.

Goal:
- /api/rgpt/runtime-mode must compile and return 200 when a valid decision is provided.
- It currently returns HTTP 500 even with a TEMP early return after enforceRuntimeDecision().

Constraints:
- Keep changes minimal and safe.
- Use existing relative imports (no @ alias).
- Ensure runtime-guard enforcement works end-to-end.

Please:
1) Identify why route.ts still 500 even with early return.
2) Provide a patch (diff) for the real repo paths, not the bundle filenames.
3) Verify:
   - route.ts builds
   - enforceRuntimeDecision import resolves
   - decision ledger file path resolution works in Next runtime
   - no double-reading of req body on GET
4) If ledger path is wrong, propose a robust fix (e.g., resolve from process.cwd() or env RGPT_LEDGER_PATH).

Files copied are prefixed with their original paths (underscored). Use them to reason, but output final patch against real paths.
