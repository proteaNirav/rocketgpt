name: Self-Heal (v4 Core AI)

# STATUS: STUB - Not Functional
# This workflow is a placeholder for future self-heal functionality.
# Current implementation only echoes TODO messages (no actual functionality).
# DO NOT enable in production until implementation is complete with proper safety gates.

# Safety notes for future implementation:
# - Triggered on CI failure
# - Must inspect and propose fixes (not auto-apply)
# - Permissions: read-only (no auto-commits)
# - Must create PR with fixes for human approval
# - Requires dry-run mode and approval workflow
