# Archived workflow: v4_ship_placeholder.yml

- **Archived on:** 2026-01-16 19:14:47
- **Reason:** Placeholder no-op workflow. Keeping stubs in .github/workflows increases CI surface noise and audit ambiguity.
- **Replacement:** None yet. When v4 ship logic is defined, add a real workflow and document it in docs/ops/ci/CI_INDEX.md.
