\# RocketGPT – v4 Core AI Roadmap  

\### (Foundation: Self-Improvement Charter + Real Self-Improving RocketGPT + AI Evolution)



> Goal: Build a \*\*Self-Healing \& Self-Improving AI System\*\* with structured safety locks, automated validation, and continuous evolution—powered by multimodal LLMs and GitHub automation.



---



\## 1. Purpose of v4 Core AI



v4 Core AI consolidates everything learned in M1–M3 and formally establishes the \*Self-Improving RocketGPT Loop\* as a first-class architecture.



This milestone introduces:

\- Autonomous code review (AI-led, diff-scoped, safe)

\- Self-healing GitHub workflows

\- Self-improvement workflows (`self\_improve.yml`)

\- Safer auto-merge pipelines with policy gates

\- Structured prompt frameworks for RocketGPT agents

\- Central knowledge libraries for future evolution

\- Human-in-the-loop safety controls

\## 2. Foundation Documents (Official)



These three documents form the \*\*backbone\*\* of v4 Core AI:



1\. \*\*Self-Improvement Charter\*\*  

&nbsp;  → `docs/self-improvement-charter.md`  

&nbsp;  Defines principles, constraints, and commitments for safe self-evolution.



2\. \*\*Real Self-Improving RocketGPT\*\*  

&nbsp;  → `docs/real-self-improving-rocketgpt.md`  

&nbsp;  Practical mechanisms, loops, and safety rails for genuine self-improving behavior.



3\. \*\*AI Evolution Roadmap\*\*  

&nbsp;  → `docs/roadmap/AI\_Evolution.md`  

&nbsp;  High-level evolution path (Narrow → General → Advanced AI for RocketGPT).



These three must guide every change in v4.

\## 3. Core Themes of v4



\### 3.1. \*\*Self-Healing\*\*

\- Auto-detection of workflow failures

\- Auto-suggestion of fixes

\- Safe rewriting of:

&nbsp; - GitHub Actions

&nbsp; - Lint configs

&nbsp; - TS/JS helper files

&nbsp; - Documentation

\- GitHub CLI utilities for quick recovery



\### 3.2. \*\*Self-Improvement\*\*

\- AI proposes improvements in small, safe diffs

\- PR templates enforce clarity and test coverage

\- Tests + Text-Guard become the approval gate

\- AI learns from:

&nbsp; - failing builds  

&nbsp; - slow endpoints  

&nbsp; - repetitive issues  

&nbsp; - missing docs  



\### 3.3. \*\*Safe Auto-Merge Framework\*\*

\- Labels like:  

&nbsp; `safe:auto-merge`, `safe:workflow-edit`, `safe:docs`  

\- AI cannot bypass branch protection rules  

\- Policy Gate ensures security never degrades



\### 3.4. \*\*AI-Orchestrated Code Review\*\*

\- Claude + ChatGPT used in:

&nbsp; - API schema review

&nbsp; - Test generation

&nbsp; - PR summaries

&nbsp; - Safety checks

\- No direct writes to `main`  

\- Only operates on \*diffs\*, never entire repo

\## 4. v4 Milestones



\### \*\*4.1. Setup Phase\*\*

\- Create all v4 folders, workflows, labels

\- Configure Text-Guard Phase-2 final inte
